# clavenar-lite — single-binary OSS edition of the proxy + ledger (drop-in alternative to the multi-service control plane)

All four Clavenar layers collapse into one process and one binary:
embedded heuristic Brain (L2), Rego policy engine (L3), SHA-256
hash-chained SQLite ledger (L4), behind an HTTP proxy/orchestrator (L1).
Developer-laptop scope — no mTLS, Vault, semantic LLM Brain, or
multi-instance velocity (those are the full edition). Apache-2.0, Rust
edition 2024.

## Build, test, lint

```bash
cargo build                                # release: cargo build --release
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --target static-binary --output type=local,dest=/tmp/clavenar-lite-static .
cargo test
./scripts/smoke-e2e.sh                     # CI e2e (needs docker): boots the runtime image — all three verdicts + park-poll-decide loop + concurrent audit read
./scripts/smoke-native-install.sh VERSION ASSET_DIRECTORY [INSTALLER_DIRECTORY]  # prebuilt release assets required
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo deny check all                       # supply-chain gate
cargo cyclonedx --format json --describe crate   # SBOM
shellcheck -S warning scripts/*.sh
docker build -t clavenar-lite:dev .
```

Host-build caveat: `target/` may be root-owned from prior docker builds — pass `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/clavenar-lite-target`. The protected publication workflow ships multi-arch amd64+arm64 only when the signed request version matches `Cargo.toml` and its source SHA matches the checked-out commit.

The native-install smoke is a release-artifact check, not an ordinary source
test: the asset directory must already contain both architecture archives and
checksums. The optional installer directory selects the matching staged
`install.sh`/`uninstall.sh`; when omitted, the repository scripts are used.

Run: single bin `clavenar-lite` (`clavenar-lite start …`); HTTP server binds `0.0.0.0:8088` (`--bind` / `CLAVENAR_LITE_BIND`, `--port` / `CLAVENAR_LITE_PORT`). Native service installs select loopback. Subcommands: `start`, `verify`, `audit <agent_id>`, `backup`, `restore`, `graduate {report,verify}`, `pending {list,get,decide}`. Every flag has a `CLAVENAR_LITE_*` env fallback (see README matrix). The protected distribution event must match the Cargo version and exact signed-BOM source SHA before the workflow publishes a versioned image or static binary.

## Layout
- `src/main.rs` — clap CLI, subcommand dispatch, fail-fast startup checks, `TcpListener` bind, `/metrics` wiring.
- `src/lib.rs` — re-exports the modules below for tests / library consumers.
- `src/proxy.rs` — L1: axum `build_router`, `AppState`, `AgentRegistry`, `ClavenarMode`, `/mcp` orchestration, pending handlers.
- `src/heuristics.rs` — L2: pure-Rust regex/substring injection/jailbreak matcher (~14 needles).
- `src/policy.rs` — L3: `regorus` Rego evaluator + in-process velocity tracker.
- `src/ledger.rs` — L4: bundled SQLite, SHA-256 hash chain, `verify`/`audit`/`backup`/`restore`, schema migration on open.
- `src/rate_limit.rs` — per-agent token-bucket gate at `/mcp` ingress (runs before brain/policy).
- `src/report.rs` — observe→enforce graduation report, Ed25519-signed offline.
- `src/slack.rs` / `src/webhook.rs` — optional fire-and-forget side-channels (Slack park alert / SIEM JSON verdict).
- `src/target_validation.rs` — normalized scheme/IDNA host/effective-port/path
  boundary matching for callback allowlists, with local/non-public targets
  rejected before storage or delivery.
- `src/hosted_safety.rs` / `src/hosted_safety_contract.rs` — fail-closed
  hosted-profile requirements and the embedded
  `clavenar.hosted-lite-safety/v1` contract.
- `src/upstream_adapter.rs` — explicit raw-local versus bounded
  `mcp-jsonrpc-v1` upstream exchange.
- `src/outbound_callback.rs` / `src/outbound_resolution_contract.rs` —
  bounded callback delivery and compiled DNS-pinning contract.
- `src/supply_chain.rs` — pins first `tools/list`, diffs later ones → `tool_schema_poisoned` row.
- `contracts/` — hosted safety, client migration, retry separation, rooted
  targets, outbound pinning, and server-execution schemas/fixtures.
- `policies/governance.rego` — baseline compiled into the executable (denylist, intent threshold, business-hours, velocity, wire-transfer review). `tests/proxy_integration.rs`. `scripts/{install,uninstall,smoke-e2e,smoke-install,smoke-native-install}.sh`. `docs/SEQUENCES.md`.
- Routes (port 8088): `GET /`,`/health`,`/readyz`,`/metrics`; `POST /mcp`; `GET /pending`, `GET /pending/{id}`, `POST /pending/{id}/decide`.

## Conventions & invariants

- **Formatting is an owning-CI gate.** Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
  before pushing Rust changes; CI runs it before check, test, and clippy.
- **The default policy is a binary invariant.** A fresh executable must start
  from an empty working directory using the embedded baseline. An explicit
  policy directory remains replacement semantics and must fail closed when it
  is missing or empty.

- **Wire + chain are byte-compatible with the full edition.** A Lite-produced chain verifies under the production ledger; full-edition `governance.rego` runs verbatim here. Don't change the hash-chain serialization or the `PolicyInput` shape without matching the full edition.
- **Decision and execution are distinct contracts.**
  `clavenar.decision/v1` is side-effect-free. Durable
  `clavenar.server-execution/v1` persists exact intent before one upstream
  attempt, replays only retained completion bytes, and reports an interrupted
  identity as uncertain without executing again. Unknown or mixed selectors
  fail before policy, ledger, or upstream access.
- Three verdicts: `200` allow / `403` deny (`security_violation`) / `202` park (`pending`). Observe mode passes everything through, still writes `authorized=false` rows, and adds `X-Clavenar-Would-Deny: true`. Every response (incl. 4xx/5xx) carries `X-Clavenar-Correlation-Id` + `X-Clavenar-Mode`.
- Default mode is `enforce` (CLI/env default); README quickstarts set `observe` explicitly — keep that distinction intact.
- `verify` exit codes are CI contracts: `0` valid, `1` runtime error, `2` for any invalid/unverifiable chain — tamper (the message points at the first bad seq) OR a row written under a newer `chain_version` this binary can't verify (message says "Upgrade", not tamper).
- Two independent auth tokens: agent `--token` gates `/mcp` + pending reads; operator `--decide-token` gates decide — so an agent can't approve its own pending. Decide is idempotent: a second decide returns `409`, never a silent overwrite.
- Callback allowlists are parsed, canonicalized URL boundaries rather than
  string prefixes. Credentials, fragments, sibling domains, local-use names,
  and non-public IP literals fail closed. The complete DNS set is validated
  before each connection, a deterministic public address is pinned while
  retaining hostname identity, and at most five manual redirects repeat the
  full allowlist/resolve/validate/pin sequence.
- Rate-limit gate emits `429` + a `RateLimitDenied` ledger row + the `clavenar_lite_rate_limit_denied_total` counter; it runs before any brain/policy work.
- **Blocking and best-effort work is bounded.** SQLite and Rego work run
  behind semaphores on `spawn_blocking`; notification tasks have a fixed
  in-flight cap and may be dropped rather than accumulating without bound.
- `--verbose-verdicts` is a dev knob, OFF by default — it leaks detector logic to the caller; the binary logs a startup warning when on.
- Dependency choices are load-bearing for the one-command static install: `reqwest` rustls-tls (no system openssl), `rusqlite` `bundled` (no system libsqlite). Don't reintroduce native-tls or a system-lib dep.
- `[lints.rust] unreachable_pub = "warn"` — keep the module surface tight; don't widen visibility past what `lib.rs` needs to re-export.

Rust house rules: clippy `-D warnings` is mandatory — fix the code, never `#[allow]` to silence (a documented false positive is the only exception). Types in a `pub` fn signature must be `pub` (no `pub(crate)` leaking through). Tests live at file bottom in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`. Prefer `writeln!` over `write!(…, "\n")` and let-chains over nested `if let`. Doc comments: no `+ ` line-start continuations (clippy reads them as list items). `deny.toml` is synced verbatim from `clavenar-specs` — edit it there first, then mirror the exact bytes. Bash scripts: `set -euo pipefail`, pass `shellcheck -S warning`, quote everything.

Commit subjects must start with a lowercase letter.
